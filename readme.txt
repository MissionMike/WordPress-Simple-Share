#About DT's Simple Share

This plugin was created to be able to quickly add a sharebar for social media sharing, with minimal options and no 3rd-party resources (helps limit http requests and resource usage)

DT's Simple Share does **not** allow you to change any meta titles, keywords, open graph data, etc. It only provides a generally-configurable sharebar of social media platforms for users to quickly share URLs from blog posts or pages.

In Settings, sharing platforms/icons can be shown or hidden, and default values can be set for share meta (Twitter "via", hashtags, etc).
