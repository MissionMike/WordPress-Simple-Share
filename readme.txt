Simplify page/post sharing with an easily added sharebar for users.

== Description ==

Please kindly report any issues or conflicts to the author, or open a new thread.

This plugin was created to be able to quickly add a sharebar for social media sharing, with minimal options and no 3rd-party resources (helps limit http requests and resource usage).

DT's Simple Share does **not** allow you to change any meta titles, keywords, open graph data, etc. It only provides a generally-configurable sharebar of social media platforms for users to quickly share URLs from blog posts or pages.

In Settings, sharing platforms/icons can be shown or hidden, and default values can be set for share meta (Twitter "via", hashtags, etc).

## Notes

SEO post title support for [Yoast SEO](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/) and [All-in-one SEO Pack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/) is built in. If no SEO title is detected for the post, the WordPress post title is used. Please note there is not yet support for using Yoast, All-in-one SEO, or other plugins' custom social media post titles.

Other SEO plugin support for post titles can be added upon request.
